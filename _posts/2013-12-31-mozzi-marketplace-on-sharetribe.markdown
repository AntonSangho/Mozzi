We (well, me and my brother Steph) are experimenting with the idea of a Mozzi marketplace where people can sell or swap things made with Mozzi.  The first test is with [Sharetribe](https://mozzi.sharetribe.com).

We hope a marketplace will help ferment the Mozzi culture, but also there's a remote thought of generating some kind of income to support the development of Mozzi.

First up is the [Mozzi Noob Kit](https://mozzi.sharetribe.com/en/listings/38888-mozzi-noob-kits) with everything you need to do the Mozzi Introductory Tutorial.

Anyone can post a listing on the Mozzi marketplace.
