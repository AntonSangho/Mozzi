MozziByte, a shield for the Arduino Pro Mini.  [On kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mozzibyte/mozzibyte-mozzi-arduino-mini-sensor-sonification-s)

Making synths with Mozzi, we frequently use the same basic audio components and connectors, and putting them together every time is a pain.  So we've created the MozziByte.

MozziByte has an amp, phono socket, speaker pins, battery connector, power switch and prototyping area for connecting sensors, knobs, and switches.

We have to order a minimum of 100 MozziBytes to make it cost effective to produce as a PCB+assembly board.

If you would like to order a MozziByte and support our initial production run please [visit our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mozzibyte/mozzibyte-mozzi-arduino-mini-sensor-sonification-s) and share it with others who may be interested.
